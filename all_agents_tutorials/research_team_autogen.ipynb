    "# Overview 🔎  \n",
    "  \n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of a multi-agent system for collaborative research using the AutoGen library. The system leverages multiple agents to interact and solve tasks collaboratively, focusing on efficient task execution and quality assurance.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Motivation  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Multi-agent systems can enhance collaborative research by distributing tasks among specialized agents. This approach aims to demonstrate how agents with distinct roles can work together to achieve complex objectives.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Key Components  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- **AutoGen Library**: Facilitates the creation and management of multi-agent interactions.  \n",
    "- **Agents**: Include a human admin, AI developer, planner, executor, and quality assurance agent, each with specific responsibilities.  \n",
    "- **Group Chat**: Manages the conversation flow and context among agents.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Method  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The system follows a structured approach:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "1. **Agent Configuration**: Each agent is set up with a specific role, behavior, and configuration using the GPT-4 model.  \n",
    "     \n",
    "2. **Role Assignment**:  \n",
    "   - **Admin**: Approves plans and provides guidance.  \n",
    "   - **Developer**: Writes code based on approved plans.  \n",
    "   - **Planner**: Develops detailed plans for task execution.  \n",
    "   - **Executor**: Executes the code written by the developer.  \n",
    "   - **Quality Assurance**: Ensures the plan and execution meet quality standards.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Interaction Management**:  \n",
    "   - **Allowed Transitions**: Defines permissible interactions between agents to maintain orderly communication.  \n",
    "   - **Graph Representation**: Visualizes agent interactions to clarify relationships and transitions.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "4. **Task Execution**: The admin initiates a task, and agents collaboratively work through planning, coding, executing, and quality checking.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Conclusion  \n",
    "  \n",
    "This notebook illustrates a robust framework for collaborative research using a multi-agent system. By distributing tasks among specialized agents and managing interactions effectively, it demonstrates a scalable approach to solving complex research tasks. This system can be adapted to various domains, enhancing collaboration and efficiency.  \n"

    "# Build your dream team: Perform Research with Multi-Agent Group Chat\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen provides a general conversation pattern called group chat, which involves more than two agents. The core idea of group chat is that all agents contribute to a single conversation thread and share the same context. This is useful for tasks that require collaboration among multiple agents.\n",
